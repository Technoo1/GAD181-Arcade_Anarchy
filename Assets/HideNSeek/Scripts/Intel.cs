//intel amount is equal to and absorbed into player ticket count (there may be no need for this script as it can be integrated into both player controller and ticket tracking scripts)
//first intel object spawns at 1 second
//intel spawns every 3 seconds after the first
//intel will not spawn if intel is already present (could change this to spawn every 3 seconds with a different key/button press required for each one available, up to maximum of 6-8?)
//detect key press from player controller script to pick up intel
//do I even need this one script?? lmao
